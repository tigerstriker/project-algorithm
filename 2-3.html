     <h1> NOW BECAUSE ALL THE F1 TEAMS ARE 18 WE WILL TALK ABAUT 5 OF THEM </h1>

      <article class= "Mercedes"> <h1> 1 </h1> 
        <p>   
            Mercedes’ Formula 1 story spans from their dominant 1950s debut with Juan Manuel Fangio and the legendary “Silver Arrows,” through a long withdrawal after the 1955 Le Mans tragedy, to a powerful return as an engine supplier in the 1990s with McLaren, winning titles with Mika Häkkinen and Lewis Hamilton, and finally becoming a full works team in 2010 after purchasing Brawn GP. Their greatest era came from 2014 to 2021, when Mercedes created the strongest hybrid engine in F1 history and achieved a record-breaking run of eight consecutive Constructors’ Championships and seven Drivers’ Championships with Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. After new 2022 regulations ended their dominance, the team entered a rebuilding phase, continuing to chase a return to the front of the grid. </p> </article>



             <article class= "Red Bull"> <h1> 2 </h1> 
             <p> 

            Red Bull Racing’s F1 story began in 2005 when energy-drink giant Red Bull bought the former Jaguar team and transformed it into a youthful, aggressive, and highly innovative outfit that quickly shook up the sport. After early development years under team principal Christian Horner and the technical genius of Adrian Newey, Red Bull rose to dominance from 2010 to 2013, winning four consecutive Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships with Sebastian Vettel. Following a quieter period during the hybrid era’s early years, Red Bull surged back to the top in 2021 when Max Verstappen won his first title, beginning a new era of success that turned him into one of the most dominant drivers in modern F1. With Verstappen, strong aerodynamics, and the Honda-powered Red Bull machines, the team established itself as the benchmark in the mid-2020s, continuing its reputation for bold strategy, innovative design, and championship-winning performance. </p> </article>





              <article class= "Ferrari"> <h1> 3 </h1> 
              <p> Ferrari’s Formula 1 story is the longest and most iconic in the sport, beginning in 1950 as the only team to compete in every season and becoming a symbol of racing heritage, passion, and Italian craftsmanship. Throughout its history, Ferrari has produced legendary drivers and eras, from Alberto Ascari’s early titles in the 1950s to Niki Lauda’s dramatic comeback championships in the 1970s and the team’s golden age with Michael Schumacher, who led Ferrari to five consecutive Drivers’ and six Constructors’ Championships between 1999 and 2004. Known for its powerful engines, distinctive red cars, and fiercely loyal global fanbase, Ferrari has continued to fight at the front through modern stars like Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Charles Leclerc, and Lewis Hamilton (from 2025), maintaining its status as the sport’s most historic and emotionally charged team even through periods of struggle and rebuilding.  </p>   </article>




                <article class= "McLaren"> <h1> 4 </h1> 
                <p> McLaren’s Formula 1 story is one of innovation, legendary drivers, and cycles of dominance, beginning in 1966 when Bruce McLaren founded the team that would grow into one of the sport’s great powerhouses. McLaren rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s with icons like Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna, winning multiple championships and becoming known for technical excellence and fierce intra-team rivalries. The 1990s and 2000s brought renewed success with Mika Häkkinen’s back-to-back titles and Lewis Hamilton’s dramatic 2008 championship, cementing McLaren’s status as a top-tier team. Though the team struggled during the mid-2010s, it rebuilt steadily with strong engineering, rising young stars like Lando Norris, and improved partnerships, returning to regular podium fights and reclaiming its identity as one of F1’s most historic, innovative, and passionately supported teams. </p>



                
                <article class= "Aston Martin"> <h1> 5 </h1> <p>

                Aston Martin’s modern Formula 1 story began in 2021 when the famous British luxury brand returned to the grid by rebranding the former Racing Point team under the ownership of Lawrence Stroll, aiming to transform it into a world-class contender. Though Aston Martin had a brief and unsuccessful F1 presence in the late 1950s, its modern era quickly gained momentum, highlighted by strong early performances and the arrival of two-time world champion Fernando Alonso in 2023, which brought credibility, leadership, and global attention. Supported by major investment, a new factory, and a fast-growing technical program—including collaboration with experienced engineers and aerodynamicists—the team positioned itself as an ambitious challenger seeking to break into Formula 1’s top tier. While still building toward consistent front-running performance, Aston Martin has become known for rapid growth, bold long-term planning, and a commitment to becoming a title-contending force in the years ahead. </p>
